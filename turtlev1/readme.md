- **Central Pattern Generator (CPG) Control**  
  - Implements Hopf oscillator–based rhythmic control for multi-joint locomotion.  
  - Supports multiple gait patterns (synchronous, diagonal, turning).  

- **Bayesian Optimization Framework**  
  - Tunes CPG parameters (frequency, amplitude, coupling) for speed, energy efficiency, and cost of transport.  
  - Uses Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate models with exploration–exploitation balance.
